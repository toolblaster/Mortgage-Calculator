                <h3>Thinking Beyond the Monthly Payment</h3>
                <p>For most people in the US, UK, or Canada, a mortgage is the biggest financial commitment they'll ever make. It’s easy to see it as just another monthly bill, but that’s a missed opportunity. A strategically managed mortgage isn't just a debt; it's a powerful tool for building long-term wealth. This guide will walk you through the core concepts our calculator uses, turning complex financial jargon into actionable insights.</p>

                <h3>The True Cost of Borrowing: Understanding NPV</h3>
                <p>NPV, or Net Present Value, is a concept used by financial pros to understand the true cost of money over time. In simple terms, a dollar today is worth more than a dollar in 10 years due to inflation and investment potential. Our calculator uses NPV to show you the real value of your interest payments in today's dollars. This helps you answer critical questions like: <em>"Am I better off paying down my low-interest mortgage, or investing that extra money in the stock market?"</em></p>

                <h3>Your Financial Power Score: Decoding the DTI Ratio</h3>
                <p>Your Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio is a key metric lenders use to gauge your ability to manage monthly payments. It’s your total monthly debt divided by your gross monthly income. A lower DTI ratio (typically below 43%) not only makes you a more attractive borrower for future loans but also gives you more financial breathing room. Our planner helps you see how your mortgage impacts your DTI, empowering you to make smarter borrowing decisions.</p>
