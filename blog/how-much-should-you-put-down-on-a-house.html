                            <h2>The 20% Down Rule: Myth vs. Reality</h2>
                            <p>For decades, the standard advice has been to put 20% down. The primary reason for this is to avoid <strong>Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI)</strong> on a conventional loan. PMI is an insurance policy that protects the lender if you default, and it adds an extra cost to your monthly payment.</p>
                            <p class="font-semibold">However, for many first-time buyers, saving up 20%—which is $80,000 on a $400,000 home—is the biggest barrier to homeownership. The reality is, the <strong>average down payment</strong> is often much lower, especially for first-time buyers.</p>

                                        <p class="text-xs text-gray-700 mt-1">Yes, it is very common. Millions of homeowners buy homes with less than 20% down using options like FHA loans (3.5% minimum) or conventional loans (3-5% minimum). The main drawback is that you will likely have to pay Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI).</p>

                                        <p class="text-xs text-gray-700 mt-1">The minimum depends on the loan type. For eligible borrowers, VA and USDA loans can be 0% down. FHA loans require as little as 3.5%. Some conventional loans for first-time buyers have minimums as low as 3%.</p>

                                        <p class="text-xs text-gray-700 mt-1">Often, yes. A larger down payment reduces the lender's risk, which can make you eligible for a lower interest rate. A lower rate can save you a significant amount of money over the life of the loan.</p>

                                        <p class="text-xs text-gray-700 mt-1">A higher credit score makes you a more attractive borrower and can help you qualify for low down payment programs. For some loans, like FHA, there are minimum credit score requirements (typically around 580) to be eligible for the low 3.5% down payment option.</p>

                                        <p class="text-xs text-gray-700 mt-1">Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI) is an insurance policy that protects the lender if you default on your loan, required when you put down less than 20% on a conventional loan. You can typically request to have PMI removed once your loan-to-value (LTV) ratio reaches 80%, meaning you have 20% equity in your home.</p>
