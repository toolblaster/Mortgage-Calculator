                        <h2 class="!mt-8">Understanding the True Cost of Owning a Home</h2>
                        <p>The first step to smart budgeting is understanding the concept of <strong>PITI</strong>: Principal, Interest, Taxes, and Insurance. While your mortgage payment (Principal & Interest) is the largest piece, the other two can add hundreds of dollars to your monthly bill. Let‚Äôs break down each element so you can plan wisely.</p>
                        <p>‚Üí First, you need a baseline. You can <a href="../#mortgage-tab" class="font-semibold text-accent hover:underline">estimate your base monthly payment here</a>.</p>
                        
                        <h2 class="!mt-8">1Ô∏è‚É£ Mortgage Payments: Your Starting Point</h2>
                        <p>This is the most straightforward cost. It's the amount you pay back to the lender each month, and it's made up of two parts:</p>
                        <ul class="space-y-2 mt-3 list-none pl-2 text-sm text-gray-800">
                             <li class="flex items-start"><span class="mr-2 text-primary font-bold">¬ª</span><strong>Principal:</strong> The portion that pays down the actual amount you borrowed.</li>
                             <li class="flex items-start"><span class="mr-2 text-primary font-bold">¬ª</span><strong>Interest:</strong> The cost of borrowing the money.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="mt-2">For example, a $400,000 loan at 6.5% for 30 years results in a principal and interest payment of about $2,528 per month.</p>

                        <h2 class="!mt-8">2Ô∏è‚É£ Property Taxes: The Annual Expense Many Forget</h2>
                        <p>Property taxes are collected by local governments to fund public services like schools, roads, and fire departments. They vary significantly by state and even by county.</p>
                         <ul class="space-y-2 mt-3 list-none pl-2 text-sm text-gray-800">
                             <li class="flex items-start"><span class="mr-2 text-primary font-bold">¬ª</span>This cost is unavoidable and is typically paid monthly into an escrow account managed by your lender.</li>
                             <li class="flex items-start"><span class="mr-2 text-primary font-bold">¬ª</span>For example, a 1.2% tax rate on a $400,000 home adds $4,800 per year, or $400 per month, to your housing costs.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>These are the fees you pay to finalize your mortgage and are one of the biggest "hidden" expenses. They typically range from 2% to 5% of the loan amount.</p>
                        <ul class="space-y-2 mt-3 list-none pl-2 text-sm text-gray-800">
                             <li class="flex items-start"><span class="mr-2 text-primary font-bold">¬ª</span>Includes fees for loan origination, appraisal, title search, and more.</li>
